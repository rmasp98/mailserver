TODO:
 - Spam filter and AV
 - roundcube or other webmail
 - virtual folders (apparenty called mailboxes)
   - All mail
   - Archive
   - Important
 - API to manage mailserver (convert bash script). Probably need client as well
   - This could allow us to move root DB password off server
   - make this gRPC could be fun
 - Pull emails from other mailboxes
   - Primarily gmail but could look into general one too
